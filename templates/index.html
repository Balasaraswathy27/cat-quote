    <div class="font"><h3>Pet owners usually fall into two camps:</h3></div>
    <h4><p>Pet owners usually fall into two camps: Dog People and Cat People. And while we believe that both make great companions, there are certain benefits of cat ownership that stand out. Yes, we know they are finicky, feisty, and generally aloof, but on the same token, cats can be wonderful companions. Here is a list of our Top 8 Reasons Cats Make Good Companions:</p></h4>
  <h2>#1 Cats are Quiet</h2>
  <h4><p>Let me preface this – cats make noise. Some cats meow whenever they want something and some meows can be loud. This is on purpose. Cats meow to communicate with people – to say hello, ask for things, and to tell us if something is wrong. What is interesting is that adult cats don’t meow at other cats. They save this as a special way to talk to their human loved ones. However, though some cats may be extra vocal, it is unlikely that you will receive a noise complaint due to a cat compared to what you might encounter with a dog. Cats are pretty content sleeping all day and getting up for the occasional crunch of their food.</p></h4>
  <h2>#2 Cats are Low Maintenance</h2>
  <center><img src="https://marvel-b1-cdn.bc0a.com/f00000000295745/cms-lc.bestfriendspetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/cat-on-lap-768x512.jpg" alt="some image"></center>
  <h4><p>Cats are small. They don’t require much space. They don’t need to go for walks or go outside. They clean themselves. Cats are low maintenance compared to other pets. They need fresh water, food, and a clean litter space. Oh, and the occasional treat.</p></h4>
  <h2>#4 Cats are Independent</h2>
  <h4><p>Independence and cats go hand-in-hand and is deeply rooted. Unlike dogs, cats are solitary predators. They must hunt alone and, in fact, their methods of stalking, hiding, and pouncing would not be successful if done in a group. Though they may seem like they would prefer to be alone, most cats enjoy the company of their favorite human. They can spend hours snuggled up beside you while periodically glancing up with an adoring face.</p></h4>
  <h2>#5 Cats have a Long Lifespan</h2>
  <h4><p>It’s been said that cats have nine lives and it often feels that way when we watch them jump from a high ledge or squeeze into tiny spaces. Factors such as diet, healthcare, and environment can have an impact on how long a cat can live. Some domestic cats can live up to 20 years old! However, on average, a cat lives 15 years compared to 12 years, the average for dogs. They are great companions for the long haul.</p></h4>
  <h2>#8 Cats are Entertaining
  </h2>
  <center><img src="https://marvel-b1-cdn.bc0a.com/f00000000295745/cms-lc.bestfriendspetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/cat-playing-768x469.jpg" alt="some image"></center>
  <h4><p>For the same reasons our cats annoy us they also provide us entertainment. Cats are sassy. They make their own rules and if we get in the way are not afraid to serve up one of their looks with “cattitude”. The glares they give us are funny. Cats also hide in the strangest places. If you haven’t spent the afternoon searching indoors for your cat, then you haven’t been a cat owner long enough. Cats will make their sleeping spots in any place left unattended – leave a closet, cupboard, or dresser drawer open and expect a cat to waltz in. Cats are also entertaining in the way that they play. They can spend hours chasing a laser light or a toy mouse. They will pounce, flip, jump, twist and turn to get the toy. It’s hard not to smile. You might not need a TV once you get a cat.</p></h4>
